# shop-backend

This is a project for *shop-vue-vuex-cloudfront* that implements its 
backend.
Here we are using the **mono-repository** approach.
Every package is a dedicated service 
that will be published to its own **AWS Lambda Function**.

## Didn't get in time with completing task-4. Planning to do this during the week.
